# RF-temperature-block 

For my home automation project I am using an egg that glows when my heating is switched on or off
example http://www.maredana.nl/home-automation/woonkamer-cv-raspberry/ (sorry Dutch)

Now I am working on a box that not only glows but also displays the current temperature.
I am going to update my site when I have it working and publish my code.
